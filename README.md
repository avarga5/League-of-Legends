Looking at Basic LoL Statistics and Clustering

This intro to League Stats will start with looking at all champion basic statistics and see if we cal cluster champions into groups.

Frist we will graph the data to look at any elbows as a starting point for our cluster number

Then we will use Kmeans clustering to better identify those groups.

Next we will normalize our data and do a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to bring down the dimensionality.

I will be using LoL data from Kaggle and will be updating the data after different patches.
